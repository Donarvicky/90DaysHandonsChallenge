ðŸ“˜ Week 1: Networking Fundamentals â€“ 90 Days of DevOps ðŸš€

Welcome to Week 1 of the 90 Days of DevOps â€“ 2025 Edition!
This week we focus on Networking basics that every DevOps engineer must know.

âœ… Task 1: OSI Model
Introduction

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes how data moves across networks. It has 7 layers, each responsible for specific tasks.

The 7 Layers of OSI

Physical Layer â†’ Wires, cables, Wi-Fi.

Data Link Layer â†’ MAC address, Ethernet.

Network Layer â†’ IP addressing, routing.

Transport Layer â†’ Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP).

Session Layer â†’ Manage sessions (start, maintain, end).

Presentation Layer â†’ Data encryption, compression.

Application Layer â†’ User-facing (HTTP, FTP, DNS).

Example

If a web page is not loading:

Check Physical Layer â†’ Cable/connection issue?

Check Network Layer â†’ Wrong IP or routing?

Check Application Layer â†’ Server issue?

Best Practices

Troubleshoot bottom-to-top.

Use mnemonics â†’ All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

Conclusion

The OSI model is a troubleshooting roadmap for network engineers.

âœ… Task 2: TCP/IP Model
Introduction

The TCP/IP model is the practical networking model used on the internet. It has 4 layers.

The 4 Layers

Network Interface â†’ Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

Internet â†’ IP addressing, routing.

Transport â†’ TCP/UDP protocols.

Application â†’ HTTP, DNS, SSH.

Example

When opening google.com:

Application Layer â†’ Browser sends HTTP request.

Transport Layer â†’ TCP splits data.

Internet Layer â†’ IP finds route.

Network Layer â†’ Data sent physically.

Testing
curl google.com

Best Practices

Use TCP when reliability matters.

Use UDP when speed matters.

Conclusion

TCP/IP is the foundation of the internet.

âœ… Task 3: Networking Protocols & Ports
Introduction

Protocols are rules of communication. Ports are doors for services.

Common Protocols & Ports

SSH (22) â†’ Remote login.

HTTP (80) â†’ Web traffic.

HTTPS (443) â†’ Secure web.

FTP (21) â†’ File transfers.

DNS (53) â†’ Domain lookup.

SMTP (25/587) â†’ Email.

MySQL (3306) â†’ Database.

Testing Ports
nc -zv <server-ip> 22
netstat -tulnp

Best Practices

Open only required ports.

Use firewall/security groups.

Prefer HTTPS over HTTP.

Conclusion

Protocols + Ports = Communication backbone of networks.

âœ… Task 4: Networking Commands Cheat Sheet
Command	Example	Usage
ping	ping google.com	Check connectivity
traceroute	traceroute google.com	Trace network path
netstat -tulnp	â€”	Show listening ports
curl	curl -I http://example.com	Test HTTP requests
dig	dig google.com	DNS lookup
nslookup	nslookup google.com	DNS lookup
ifconfig / ip a	â€”	Show IP details
Best Practices

Use ping + traceroute for connectivity issues.

Use netstat to see whatâ€™s running.

Use curl to debug web apps.

âœ… Task 5: AWS EC2 & Security Groups
Introduction

When you launch an AWS EC2 instance, you need a Security Group (SG) to control who can access your server and on which ports.

Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance

AWS Console â†’ EC2 â†’ Launch Instance.

Name: my-first-ec2.

AMI: Amazon Linux (Free Tier).

Type: t2.micro.

Create/Select key pair (for SSH).

Configure Security Group.

Step 2: Security Group Basics

Inbound rules â†’ Who can connect to EC2.

Outbound rules â†’ Where EC2 can connect out.

Default:

Inbound = empty (no one can connect).

Outbound = all allowed (EC2 can reach internet).

Step 3: Add Rules

SSH (22) â†’ Allow My IP.

HTTP (80) â†’ Allow 0.0.0.0/0.

HTTPS (443) â†’ Allow 0.0.0.0/0.

Step 4: Connect
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>

Step 5: Testing Rules

If SSH â†’ only your IP can connect.

If HTTP open â†’ everyone can view webserver.

Remove HTTP rule â†’ server not reachable on port 80.

Best Practices

Never open SSH (22) to 0.0.0.0/0.

Open HTTP/HTTPS for websites.

Keep DB ports private.

Conclusion

Security Groups = firewall for your EC2. Always allow only whatâ€™s required.
